This folder is intended to hold marketing-friendly fonts used by the poster generator.

We prefer open-license fonts (Google Fonts / SIL Open Font License). Use the `download_fonts.ps1`
script in the project root to automatically fetch a curated set of families (regular/bold/italic where available).

DO NOT commit proprietary fonts unless you have the rights to do so. The script downloads only families that are hosted in the Google Fonts repository.

If you want to add a font manually, copy the .ttf/.otf files into this folder and restart the application.
